## @frtheatelier
> *per aspera ad astra*
- CS student @ UofT (batch 2028)
- Interested in game dev, web dev and UI/UX design
- Reach out primarily by email: frtheatelier@outlook.com

### Aside
- I do digital art. (Slowly) posting old and recent art on **@frtheatelier** on instagram
- Most of my projects are basic games made in Python or with Javascript logic
- Currently refreshing Python skills as well as build up on pre-existing knowledge

### Experiences
> I have some experience with various languages, frameworks and software, although they're nothing too major. Most of them I have to relearn, to be honest.
